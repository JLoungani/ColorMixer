Color Mixer
==========

A Java implementation of the Kubelka-Munk Theory of Reflectance for mixing colors.  This implementation uses a simplified version of the Kubelka-Munk model that assumes all colors have the same concentration when blending and that all colors are opaque.

Goal
==========
The ultimate goal of this project is to have a intuitive (subtractive color model) yet accurate color mixing function of the form:

`Color mix(Color a, Color b)`
